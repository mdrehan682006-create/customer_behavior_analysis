📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard
1. Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow — from data loading and cleaning to SQL querying, dashboard creation, and business reporting.
The objective of this project is to:

1.Load and explore raw data using Python
2.Perform data cleaning and transformation
3.Execute SQL queries for deeper analysis
4.Build an interactive dashboard in Power BI
5.Create a structured business report
6.Present insights using a PPT created with Gamma

This project highlights practical skills required for a Data Analyst role.

2. Dataset:-
1.The dataset was loaded using Python (Pandas).
2.It contains structured business-related data (e.g., sales, customers, products, or similar).
3.Data includes numerical, categorical, and date fields.
4.Missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies were handled during cleaning.

(Dataset can be replaced with actual dataset name if needed.)

3. Tools & Technologies Used:-
1.Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data loading, cleaning & EDA
2.SQL – Data querying and aggregation
3.PostgreSQL
4.MySQL
5.Microsoft SQL Server
6.Power BI – Dashboard development
7.Gamma – PPT creation
8.Microsoft Excel – Initial data review (if applicable)

4. Project Steps
Step 1: Data Loading (Python)
1.Imported dataset using Pandas.
2.Checked data types and structure.
3.Reviewed summary statistics.

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1.Identified trends, patterns, and distributions.
2.Visualized data using bar charts, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.
3.Detected missing values and outliers.

Step 3: Data Cleaning
Removed duplicate records.
Handled missing values.
Standardized column names and formats.
Converted data types where required.

Step 4: SQL Analysis
Imported cleaned data into relational database.
Performed:
SELECT queries
GROUP BY aggregations
JOIN operations
Filtering using WHERE
Subqueries
This step improved analytical efficiency and demonstrated database skills.

Step 5: Power BI Dashboard
Connected Power BI to cleaned dataset.
Created calculated measures.
Designed interactive visuals:
KPI cards
Bar and line charts
Filters & slicers
Trend analysis visuals

Step 6: Report & Presentation
Prepared a detailed analytics report summarizing:
Key findings
Business insights
Recommendations
Created a professional PPT using Gamma for stakeholder presentation.

5. Dashboard:-
The Power BI dashboard includes:
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Monthly/Yearly trends
Category-wise analysis
Customer/Product performance insights
Interactive filters for better decision-making
The dashboard focuses on clarity, interactivity, and business impact.

6. Results & Insights:-

Identified top-performing categories/products.
Highlighted revenue trends and growth patterns.
Detected data quality issues and resolved them.
Provided actionable recommendations to improve performance.
Delivered a clear visual representation of business metrics.

This project demonstrates:
Strong data cleaning skills
SQL querying capability
Visualization expertise
Business understanding
End-to-end analytics workflow execution

If you'd like, I can also create:
A shorter GitHub-optimized version
A more technical version
Or a version customized for a specific dataset (Sales, HR, Finance, etc.)
